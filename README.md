# Build an App to Increase Healthcare Cost Transparency

This project aims to address the lack of transparency in healthcare costs by developing an application that empowers patients with information about the cost of care. By providing users with the ability to search for cost ranges and averages based on procedures and zip codes, the application enables individuals to plan ahead and make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Procedure Cost Search**: Users can search for the cost range and average cost of healthcare procedures.
- **Location-Based Cost Information**: The application provides recommendations for the most affordable locations near a given zip code for specific procedures.
- **Specialty-Specific or General Coverage**: The application can be customized to focus on a specific medical specialty or cover all physician office visit types.

## Resources

Used thefollowing resources:

- **Pricing Data**: Access pricing data in CSV or API format from [here](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/).
