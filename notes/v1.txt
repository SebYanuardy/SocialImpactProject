VERSION 1.5 ( Front End)


Things that need to be fixed: 
    - I also need to add the buttons and plan out the different sections
    - Add some cool transitons to the main page as well as the information about 
    the site 
    - Need to slow down the sliding from one sections to the other
    - Find a way to add the backend 

Things that need to be added:
    -LOGIN screen so the user can manage what service they need and save preferances
    -Need to make a menu that happends when i press the name of the logo and will change 
    basde on if you logged in or not with different functions 
    make the other pages by planning it out (Maybe Keep the same color tone going?) 
    -Work on the animations and that should be it for the front end.
    -Create a feature where if you log in the top right should change into your name and the profile pic 
    then from there maybe create a drop dwon from the profile to make sure the user 
    can access their profile with different saved things etc
